---

## 10. Creating Templates

This section explains how to create custom BMAD templates and configure role associations.

### Template File Format

Templates are Markdown files (`.md`) that contain:
1. Optional YAML frontmatter for metadata
2. BMAD-compliant sections with variable placeholders

### YAML Frontmatter

The recommended way to create a template is to include YAML frontmatter at the beginning of the file. This frontmatter is delimited by `---` markers:

```yaml
---
name: my-template-name
description: Brief description of what this template does
role: developer
workflow_phase: development
version: "1.0"
---

# Template content starts here...
```

### Available Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier for the template |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description of template purpose |
| `roles` | Recommended | List of BMAD roles that can use this template |
| `role` | Alternative | Single BMAD role (use `roles` for multiple) |
| `workflow_phase` | Recommended | Either `planning` or `development` |
| `version` | Optional | Template version (e.g., "1.0", "2.0") |
| `category` | Optional | Category for organization |
| `tags` | Optional | List of tags for searchability |

### Associating a Template with a Single Role

For templates that are specific to one role, use the `role` field:

```yaml
---
name: backend-implementation
description: Template for backend feature implementation
role: developer
workflow_phase: development
---

## Your Role

You are a senior backend developer responsible for implementing server-side features.

## Input

You will receive:
- Feature requirements: {{FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS}}
- Technical specifications: {{TECHNICAL_SPECS}}

## Output Requirements

Provide:
- Implementation code
- Unit tests
- API documentation
```

### Associating a Template with Multiple Roles

Many templates can be useful for multiple roles. Use the `roles` field (note the plural) with a list:

```yaml
---
name: technical-design-document
description: Comprehensive technical design specification
roles:
  - architect
  - developer
workflow_phase: development
version: "2.0"
---

## Your Role

Act as a technical architect or senior developer creating detailed design specifications.

## Input

You will receive:
- Requirements documentation: {{REQUIREMENTS}}
- System constraints: {{CONSTRAINTS}}

## Output Requirements

Your output will include:
- System architecture diagrams
- Component specifications
- Implementation guidelines
```

### How Multiple Roles Work

When a template has multiple roles configured:

1. **Primary Role**: The first role in the `roles` list is considered the primary role. This is used for filtering and display purposes.

2. **Role Filtering**: The template will appear when filtering by any of its associated roles.

3. **Role Display**: All associated roles are displayed as badges on the template card.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: If you use the singular `role` field, it is automatically converted to a single-item `roles` list.

### Available Roles

| Role ID | Display Name | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `orchestrator` | Orchestrator | Coordinates overall workflow and agent interactions |
| `analyst` | Analyst | Performs analysis and research tasks |
| `pm` | Project Manager | Manages product planning and requirements |
| `architect` | Architect | Designs system architecture and technical specifications |
| `scrum_master` | Scrum Master | Manages sprints, backlogs, and release planning |
| `developer` | Developer | Implements frontend, backend, DevOps, and UX solutions |
| `qa` | QA Engineer | Handles testing, security analysis, and quality assurance |

### Available Workflow Phases

| Phase ID | Display Name | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `planning` | Planning Phase | Requirements gathering, architecture design, and task planning |
| `development` | Development Phase | Implementation, testing, and deployment |

### Auto-Detection (Fallback)

If no explicit roles are specified in the frontmatter, the system will attempt to auto-detect the role based on:

1. **Filename patterns**: Keywords like `developer`, `architect`, `qa`, `pm` in the filename
2. **Content analysis**: Examining the `## Your Role` section for role indicators
3. **Default**: If no role can be detected, defaults to `developer`

### Template Structure Requirements

All templates must include these required BMAD sections:

1. **## Your Role** - Defines who the AI should act as
2. **## Input** - Specifies what information is being provided
3. **## Output Requirements** - Describes expected output format

### Variable Syntax

Templates support two variable syntaxes:
- Double braces: `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}`
- Square brackets: `[VARIABLE_NAME]`

Example:
```markdown
## Input

- Project name: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- Feature description: [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]
- Technical stack: {{TECH_STACK}}
```

### Complete Template Example

Here's a complete example of a multi-role template:

```yaml
---
name: api-design-document
description: API design and documentation template for architects and developers
roles:
  - architect
  - developer
workflow_phase: development
version: "1.0"
category: documentation
tags:
  - api
  - design
  - rest
---

## Your Role

You are an experienced API designer responsible for creating comprehensive API specifications that balance developer experience with system performance.

## Input

You will receive:
- Service name: {{SERVICE_NAME}}
- Business requirements: {{BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS}}
- Target consumers: {{TARGET_CONSUMERS}}
- Authentication requirements: {{AUTH_REQUIREMENTS}}

## Output Requirements

Your output must include:
1. **API Overview**: High-level description of the API
2. **Endpoint Definitions**: RESTful endpoint specifications
3. **Request/Response Schemas**: JSON schemas for all payloads
4. **Authentication**: Authentication and authorization details
5. **Error Handling**: Standard error response formats
6. **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting policies

## Context

Consider these factors when designing the API:
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Performance constraints
- Security best practices

## Examples

Include sample requests and responses for each endpoint.
```

### Adding Templates to the System

Templates can be added in two ways:

1. **GitHub Sync**: Place templates in your GitHub repository and sync them using the GitHub Synchronization feature (see Section 9).

2. **Local Files**: Add template files directly to the `forge/templates/agents/` directory.

3. **Django Admin**: Use the Django admin interface at `/admin/` to manually create templates.

### Best Practices

1. **Use `roles` for multi-role templates**: When a template can be used by multiple roles, always use the `roles` list field
2. **Order roles by relevance**: Put the primary/most relevant role first in the `roles` list
3. **Keep roles consistent**: Use the exact role IDs defined in Available Roles
4. **Include workflow_phase**: Helps organize templates by development stage
5. **Use descriptive names**: The `name` field should clearly identify the template's purpose
6. **Add version information**: Track template versions for change management
7. **Write clear descriptions**: Help users understand when to use each template
